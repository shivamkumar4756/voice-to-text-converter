# Voice to Text System

This Python script uses the SpeechRecognition library to convert your voice into text. It utilizes Google's speech recognition engine to perform the conversion. Please make sure you have an active internet connection while running this code.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to install the `SpeechRecognition` library. You can do this by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```
pip install SpeechRecognition
```


## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. The script will capture your voice and attempt to convert it into text.
3. Speak into your microphone.
4. The recognized text will be displayed on the console.

Make sure to run the script in an environment with an active internet connection, as it relies on Google's servers for speech recognition.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to handle the following situations:

- If no speech is detected within the specified timeout, it will prompt you to try again.
- If there is an issue with the Google Speech Recognition service, it will display an error message.
- If Google Speech Recognition cannot understand the audio, it will inform you of the issue.

Feel free to modify the error handling or further enhance the code as per your requirements.
